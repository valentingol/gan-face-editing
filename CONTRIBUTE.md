# How to contribute

**For the moment we don't accept merge requests from external users.** This file aims to be used by the co-authors of this repository.

## Commit message

Commit messages are written in present tense (e.g. `:art: refactor training loop` instead of `:art: refactored training loop`).
They also start with one or two applicable emoji. This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit (one kind of action per commit!).

Make many but small commits!
